### A Bacteria Evolution Simulation with specified bacteria species.

Still in the process and there are soooo many things to do...

Current components:
 Ecosystem,
 Bacteria,
 BeginSimulation,
 testsimulation

Current Bacterias(It's very basic for now):
 Coccus,
 Bacillus, 
 Spirillum,
 Rickettsia,
 Mycoplasma

main class << environment, degree(celcius), area magnitude(this determines maximum amount of bacteria in the environment)

sub classes << bacterias, other variables, selection types(natural selection depends on main class variables),other beings(like fungals which eats bacterias or algs), symbiotic relationships(mutualism, commensalism, parasitsm), genetics(dna microarray information or genetics code etc), basic parameters like growth rate(fabrication), lifetime, amount of given aliments, particular philes or phobes(antibiotic) of species etc.  ((carnivores,herbivores,decomposers)

test class and GUI << in the test class all the variables and parameters will be entered and processed by classes.


It'd be more complicated than written here...
